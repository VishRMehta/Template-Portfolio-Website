                <h4>Computer Science Undergrad @ QMUL</h4>
                <p>
                    I am an aspiring software engineer who wants to work on client facing products as I want my work to make an impact in other people's lives.
                    I plan to complete my Bachelors in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London in 2026 and then perhaps pursue further education in a field of my choice.
                    As of now, I am using my time in my bachelors to find the niche I enjoy in this vast field as I can easily adapt to emerging technologies.
